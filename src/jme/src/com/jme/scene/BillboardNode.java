/**
 * <code>BillboardNode</code> defines a node that always orients towards the
 * camera. However, it does not tilt up/down as the camera rises. This keep
 * geometry from appearing to fall over if the camera rises or lowers.
 * <code>BillboardNode</code> is useful to contain a single quad that has a
 * image applied to it for lowest detail models. This quad, with the texture,
 * will appear to be a full model at great distances, and save on rendering and
 * memory. It is important to note that the billboards orientation will always
 * be up (0,1,0). This means that a standard camera with up (0,1,0) is the only
 * camera setting compatible with <code>BillboardNode</code>.
