/**
 * <code>JmeType</code> JmeType derived classes are used to create
 * strongly typed enumerations.  Using a strongly typed enumeration
 * has benefits over using intrinsic types or their wrappers,
 * ie int, boolean, String, etc.  For instance, the strongly typed
 * enumeration can only be compared against the same type, no accidental
 * crossover of type comparison.  Strongly typed enumerations also allow
 * effective method overloading, performFoo(FooType1 type) has a different
 * signature than performFoo(FooType2 type).
