/**

 *
 * <code>WidgetAnimatedImage</code> is a widget that draws an animated 2d image.
 *
 * The image may be scaled by four methods:
 *   SCALE_MODE_NONE - The image will not be scaled.
 *   SCALE_MODE_SIZE_TO_FIT - The image will be scaled to fill the size of the widget.
 *   SCALE_MODE_ABSOLUTE - The image is scaled vertically and horizontally by a percentage of the original size of the image.
 *   SCALE_MODE_RELATIVE - The image is scaled vertically and horizontally by a percentage of the size of the widget.
